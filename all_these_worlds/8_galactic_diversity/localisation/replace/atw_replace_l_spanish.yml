 pc_frozen:0 "Telluric World"

 # Star localizations
 pc_b_star:0 "Blue-white Supergiant"
 pc_b_star_desc:0 "These huge class A or B stars are very bright and blue. Although somewhat rare, the luminosity of these stars make them among the most visible to the naked eye."
 pc_a_star:0 "White Giant"
 pc_a_star_desc:0 "These relatively young bluish-white stars are typically among the most visible to the naked eye. They are large and rotate very quickly, but will eventually evolve into slower and cooler red giants."
 pc_f_star:0 "White Star"
 pc_f_star_desc:0 "F-type stars are fairly large and often referred to as yellow-white dwarfs. Although they often emit significant amounts of UV radiation, their wide habitable zones have a good chance of supporting life-bearing worlds."
 pc_g_star:0 "Yellow Star"
 pc_g_star_desc:0 "Often referred to as yellow dwarfs, K and G type stars actually range in color from whitish to slightly orange. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. Although their lifespans are shorter than red stars, worlds inside the habitable zone of a yellow star often enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life."
 pc_k_star:0 "Yellow Supergiant"
 pc_k_star_desc:0 "Yellow supergiants generally have spectral types of F and G, although sometimes late A or early K stars are included. These are stars that have evolved away from the main sequence, expanding and becoming more luminous."
 pc_m_star:0 "Red Dwarf"
 pc_m_star_desc:0 "The most common stars in the universe. Their low luminosity means they are difficult to observe with the naked eye from afar. Although they typically have an extremely long lifespan, red dwarfs emit almost no UV light resulting in unfavorable conditions for most forms of life."
 pc_t_star:0 "Brown Dwarf"
 pc_t_star_desc:0 "Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that lack the mass to sustain hydrogen fusion. Roughly the size of large gas giants, they have a much greater density. Their low luminosity and comparatively small heat generation means that planets orbiting them are unlikely to support life."
 pc_m_giant_star:0 "Red Giant"
 pc_m_giant_star_desc:0 "With a large radius and comparatively low surface temperature, red giants are stars of moderate mass in a late stage of stellar evolution. Their expanded stellar atmospheres and high luminosity make for distant habitable zone orbits."
 
 # Start Screen Bios
 START_SCREEN_UNE:0 "Much has happened since modern Humans first emerged in Africa some 200,000 years ago. Our kind spread rapidly across most of the globe and soon the first civilizations took form.\n\nScientific progress has been swift, though not without cost. Wars claimed millions of lives even before the atom was tamed, and the turmoil of the 21st century saw the mandate of the United Nations gradually expanded in an effort to create stability. By the early 22nd century the supranational organization had become a de facto world government.\n\nOver a century has passed since the loss of the Ulysses Arkships as they went through a wormhole discovered in the Sirius star system, and the subsequent social and political turmoil which prevented further space exploration initiatives, until now. With the recent completion of the first scientific starship, mankind is about to embark on a new era of space exploration!"
 START_SCREEN_CM:0 "More than a century has passed since the great ark ship Chrysanthemum carried a quarter million of our ancestors from distant Earth to the harsh world we have come to know as [GetHomeWorldName]. After a long and perilous journey through the wormhole found in Sirius, the colonists rejoiced when they first saw sunlight again - albeit from a foreign star.\n\nThe early years were difficult with marginal living conditions. Citizen militias were formed to fight off the lethal alien wildlife that we found ourselves sharing our new home with, and cultivating the terrestrial crops that had been brought proved harder than imagined. Yet for each challenge overcome, we became stronger.\n\nOnce this new world had been tamed, our numbers grew exponentially. The last few decades have seen great leaps in technology, and we are now - finally - ready to reach out and reclaim the stars from whence we came!"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans1_desc:0 "The myriad Human nations that constitute their interstellar government are disparate, yet united in purpose. These bipedal mammalians have developed a society that encourages and even thrives on individual freedoms and cultural differences - as a result, Humans tend to integrate well with alien populations.\n\nDespite this, they have strong martial traditions (produced by millennia of intermittent warfare on their homeworld) and their sometimes aggressive and unpredictable nature should not be underestimated."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2_desc:1 "The UN-sponsored Ulysses Initiative oversaw the construction of six great ark ships in low Earth orbit at the end of the 21st century. The ships, carrying a quarter million colonists each, were sent through a recently discovered subspace phenomenon on the outer edge of the Sirius star system - a small, unstable wormhole. None were heard from again.\n\nYet unbeknownst to Earth, one of the ark ships survived the passage and established a flourishing colony on a primordial alien moon. The pioneers who tamed this world were determined to realize humanity's manifest destiny - dominion over the galaxy at any cost."
