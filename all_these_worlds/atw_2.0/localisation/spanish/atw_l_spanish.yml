 gdengine.09.desc:0 "Rumours from the private sector claim Venus and Titan have underground deposits of liquid or frozen water that might allow Human colonies to develop there. Do you want to investigate these rumours?\n\n§GOption A:§!Ridiculous.\n\n§GOption B:§!If Venus could be developed, it could one day rival the Earth, send an exploration team to investigate, but ignore the rumours about Titan, its too cold anyway.\n\n§GOption C:§!Venus is too hot, how could we ever change such an environment? But if there's even a remote possibility of having an outpost in the outer system on Titan, we should not ignore it!\n\n§GOption D:§!Any private company able to operate outside our planet should be taken seriously! Explore both possibilities."
