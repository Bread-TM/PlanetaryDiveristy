###Domed Colonies
#Megastructure Decisions
 pd_domed_colony_0: "Build Domed Colony"
 pd_domed_colony_0_DESC: "As this planet has the potential to be terraformed we can set up a Domed Colony here to help prepare the planet for it's eventually transformation."
 pd_domed_colony_0_MEGASTRUCTURE_DETAILS: "A §YDomed Colony§! is a collection of self-sustaining planetside habitation domes on an uninhabitable planet."
 requires_terraforming_candidate: "$TRIGGER_FAIL$Must have a Terraforming Candidate modifier."
 requires_correct_planet_class: "$TRIGGER_FAIL$Planet Class must support Domed Colony construction."

#Planet Classes
 pc_pd_domed_colony_barren: "Barren Domed Colony"
 pc_pd_domed_colony_barren_desc: "Barren and rocky world with a thin or non-existent atmosphere. The surface is covered in meteor impact craters and utterly devoid of life. Domed colonies have been built on the surface, allowing for permanent habitation."

#Modifiers
 hab_terraforming_candidate:0 "Terraforming Candidate"
 hab_terraforming_candidate_desc:0 "Though barren and devoid of life, this planet has water in frozen form and may once have been home to a thriving ecosystem. With the right technology, it could be terraformed into a habitable world."
 pd_domed_colony: "Domed Colony"
 pd_domed_colony_desc: "The colony's residents thrive under an advanced network of protective domes, shielding them from the planet's inhospitable conditions. While offering safety, these structures demand high maintenance and expansion costs."
